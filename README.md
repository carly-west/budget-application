# Overview

This program allows users to update the amount spent on Chick-Fil-A, as well as add and remove restaurants from the database. It pulls and updates a Firestore database using Firebase.

The purpose of writing this software was to learn how to connect Kotlin and Android Studio with a Firestore database.

# Cloud Database

I used a Firestore database through Firebase.

The data is saved in different fields- the fields contain the restaurant, and the value contains the amount spent at the restaurant.

# Development Environment

I used Android Studio with Firebase.

# Future Work

* Ability to choose which restaurant to add to
* Show how much money spent on each restaurant
* Use different collections documents to organize data
