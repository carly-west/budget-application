# Overview

This program allows users to update the amount spent on Chick-Fil-A, as well as add and remove restaurants from the database. It pulls and updates a Firestore database using Firebase.

The purpose of writing this software was to learn how to connect Kotlin and Android Studio with a Firestore database.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of the cloud database.}

# Cloud Database

I used a Firestore database through Firebase.

The data is saved in different fields- the fields contain the restaurant, and the value contains the amount spent at the restaurant.

# Development Environment

I used Android Studio with Firebase.
